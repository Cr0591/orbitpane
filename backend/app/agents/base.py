    Discovery shells out to the agent CLI, which talks to the network: `agy

    synchronously inside an `async def` route froze the whole server — a cold
    start fires `/api/agents`, `/api/models`, `/api/conversations` and
    `/api/history` together, and the three that needed no CLI at all sat behind
    the one that did, long enough for the client to abort them and leave its
    skeletons up.

    So the request path only ever reads a snapshot, and refreshing is an
    awaitable that runs the probe in a worker thread. A stale list is served
    while a single background refresh replaces it.

    The first read after a restart used to be the exception: it had nothing to
    serve, so `/api/agents` and every `/api/models` sat on a probe that takes
    seconds — exactly when a client reconnects after a deploy. With a `store`,
    the last successful probe is remembered across restarts and served as stale
    at once, so only an installation that has never completed a probe waits.
