        Refreshing is what makes this awaitable: a provider discovers its

        thread rather than on the event loop, where it would stall every other
        request in flight. `describe` itself only reads the cache.

        `refresh` limits the refresh to one provider, so a caller that only
        needs one list never waits on another provider's probe — a Codex
        project's model picker used to sit behind Antigravity's network round
        trip. The others are still described, from whatever they have cached.
